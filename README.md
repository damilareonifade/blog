# blog
My first Uploaded github project creating a blog
From here we move to higher levels no stopping no snoozing 
We keep Coding
I would have actually done more than this but I have wasted a lot of time cramming code rather than understanding the logic behind writing code.

So I would advice any beginner here to learn more of algorithm and logic rather than cramming codes in a tutorial
And a very Big shout out to Very academy for the opportunity to learn a lot.
